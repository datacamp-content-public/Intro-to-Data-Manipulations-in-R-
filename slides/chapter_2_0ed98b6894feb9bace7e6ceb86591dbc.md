##  Some potential issues when manipulating data using Excel:




```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "883bb9005a"
```

`@part1`
- Large datasets in Excel spread sheets can be problematic (e.g. file collapses or it is too slow), specially if the file contains numerous formulas. 
   
- The steps that were followed to produced an output cannot be clearly tracked, so it is is difficult to find out what is wrong or incomplete. 

- If you want to change the layout of your data table, doing so can be quite cumbersome and time-consuming.

- Frequently, repetitive operations needs to be done as the data gets updated (e.g. produce a new pivot tables).

## How R (or other programming languages) can help

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ef55d8005f"
```

`@part1`
` ` 

- R is better equipped to handle large amounts of data, so this is a much more efficient solution to dealing with data that would simply cause Excel to freeze up.

- Complex and repetitive tasks can be automated with a just few lines of code. 
   
- Making your R code available to others makes your work both **reproducible** and **transparent**.

- Good for collaboration and also good for reproducibility.
