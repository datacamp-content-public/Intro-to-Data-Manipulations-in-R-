## The 'Dyplr' package

`@part1`
* R contains a large number of pre-defined functions.

* In addition, people around the world collaborate to create new functions or improve existing ones.

* Normally developers create functions with a similar general purpose and keep them into 'packages' or 'libraries'. 

* This training will focus on 'Dplyr' which is one of the most important libraries in R developed to do Data Manipulation.

## Five main verbs in dplyr

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "4686cbeeef"
```

`@part1`
The dplyr package contains five key data manipulation functions, also called verbs:

- `select()`, which returns a subset of the columns,
- `filter()`, that is able to return a subset of the rows,
- `arrange()`, that reorders the rows according to single or multiple variables,
- `mutate()`, used to add columns from existing data,
- `summarise()`, which reduces each group to a single row by calculating aggregate measures.
